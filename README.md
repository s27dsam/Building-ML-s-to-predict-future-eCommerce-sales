# Future e-Commerce Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a suite of machine learning models developed using PySpark to predict future e-Commerce sales. The project includes comprehensive data processing pipelines and implements various algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and K-means clustering for customer segmentation.

## Project Structure

- `gbt_model_new11`: Gradient-Boosted Trees model artifacts.
- `ML_eCommerce_sales.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the ML pipelines and analysis.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Large-scale data extraction and transformation using PySpark.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Trees models.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluation using area under ROC curve.
- **Segmentation**: Customer segmentation using K-means clustering.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have a Spark environment set up. You can run the Jupyter notebook directly if you have a local Spark setup or use a Dockerized Spark service.

### Prerequisites

- Apache Spark
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
Install the required Python packages:

Start your Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

jupyter notebook
or jupyter lab
Open the ML_eCommerce_sales.ipynb notebook and run the cells.

Usage
Follow the steps in the ML_eCommerce_sales.ipynb notebook for detailed instructions on data loading, pre-processing, model training, evaluation, and customer segmentation.
